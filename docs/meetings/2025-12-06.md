## updates about repo server and DNS

Javier spoke in person with NicoEchaniz, that is currently the only one who has the contact of CodigoSur for modifying the DNS entries.

Ilario: This is clearly a problem. 
Should we buy the domain and transfer it (we need NicoE collaboration for this). We can afford this with the money from the donations.

Javier and NicoE created a subdomain requested by Gothos
https://firmware-selector.libremesh.org/

Currently the repo server is down, and its content has been re-created and hosted on Valsamoggia's Antennine server, thanks! The links to repo.libremesh.org and downloads.libremesh.org have been removed from the website, waiting for that server to be restored (we need NicoE to ask CodigoSur or give us the contact with CodigoSur).

## mastodon account: approving usage rules

Our Mastodon account is:

## Status of inclusion of GSoC 2025 contributed code

### Virtualizing LibreMesh with WiFi

The project is complete and it works, with some patience for setting up all its components.

https://github.com/VGDSpehar/libremesh-virtual-mesh

We can ask Victor to merge that documentation with the one present here:
https://github.com/libremesh/lime-packages/blob/master/VIRTUALIZING.md

### VLANs and Babeld

Removing VLANs from Babeld requires much more testing:
https://github.com/libremesh/lime-packages/pull/1210

### odhcpd shared-state leases

Sharing DHCP leases with odhcpd requires just minimal testing, to be done!
https://github.com/libremesh/lime-packages/pull/1199

## Next GSoC

Timeline for 2026 is available
https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline

we can start proposing projects here:
https://github.com/freifunk/project

ideas:
complete the babeld-only version of LibreMesh

## Scheduling 2026 meetings

So far it has been: "first Saturday of Feb, Apr, Jun, Ago, Oct, Dec at 13 UTC".

For this year for me can be good also on friday, better than saturday... we can add some saturday to be inclusive..

but we could use thesame algorithm so the first friday of the month!


Ilario: An extra meeting in the first week on January? when?

Cri: for me the 6th of january can be nice because in Italy is holiday, is the holiday of a witch, la befana.
same time? also sunday 4 of january can be fine for me! or friday 2th.

So.. I have to decide because I'm the only one in the meeting..

Friday 2th of january!

Meeting for the year 2026:

Friday 6th February 13UTC
Friday 3th April 13UTC
Friday 5th June 13UTC
Friday 7th August 13UTC
Friday 2th October 13UTC
Friday 4th December 13UTC

## Archive meetings' minutes 2025
