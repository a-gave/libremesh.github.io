## 1. about repo server

at the reboot, the machine doesn't come up again.
So now we have some broken links: 

1.https://repo.libremesh.org/selector/
( this is linked from our page: https://libremesh.org/getit.html)

2.https://repo.libremesh.org/

Cri: I think we can plan to buy a small VPS just to expose the last firmwares, Probably the expense can be of 50e (hetzner (DE) price for the smallest machine)..

Plan A: in the meanwhile we can link the repo we have in our network (https://antennine.org):
https://firmware-libremesh.antennine.org/

3. https://downloads.libremesh.org

We have probably to change the DNS of this 2 records:
https://repo.libremesh.org/
https://downloads.libremesh.org

Who can do this?

Plan B: If know who manage the domain take time, I think we can just change the link in the website.
I can do this (Cri) 

Follow answers in mailinlist, a deadline can be 2weeks, to switch from the plan A to plan B.

NEWS: Ilario wrote to Nico Echaniz, but we have not answer. 
Maybe we can ping Jesi, Cri can write to Jesi.

## 4. Mailinglist

on air we resolved a small issue on receiving/sending email

## 5. Translation

- limeapp
- documentations on the website
- others

At which point are we?

-translatewiki.net was a great point to receive contribution of translators.. and Altermundi used it for translating lime-app and some PDF documentation about how to set up a community network. But they did not want to provide TranslateWiki with the direct write access to the repositories, so they set up a temporary repository where the translations would go, but then they should have been manually copied and pasted from this temporary repository to the official lime-app and Altermundi's documentation repository. For some years, Nico Pace did this copy and paste work. When Nico Pace stopped, nobody from Altermundi took over this task. When TranslateWiki realized that the effort of their volunteers was wasted (they commented this here https://github.com/libremesh/lime-packages/issues/257#issuecomment-1941026915 and here https://github.com/libremesh/lime-app/issues/431#issuecomment-2476178385), they gave some time for fixing this. Ilario contacted all the Altermundi people but no one stepped forward for managing this. So TranslateWiki removed all LibreMesh-related things from their website.

What would still make sense to translate is lime-app and the LibreMesh website.

the website example as some pages translated:
https://libremesh.org/
https://libremesh.org/docs/en_quick_starting_guide.html

there are some translation in ES and in IT, but there are not engine that manage translate, but thereare different version of the same page in different language ( like wikipedia)
Operative, to translate the website we use git: 
example https://github.com/libremesh/libremesh.github.io/tree/master/docs
