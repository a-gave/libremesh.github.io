## Closing thoughts on GSoC projects

Pirania updating project:
https://gist.github.com/henmohr/6a1903f14fdd081e8b0560af2e8b7850
https://github.com/libremesh/lime-packages/pull/1133

should we add pirania to the suggested packages of LiMe?  sounds a good thing

Hiure have to finish some test, before the new release of pirania.
