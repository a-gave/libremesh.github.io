Some data from Gothos and Ilario, with a script for replicating the analysis
https://github.com/ilario/wifi-distance-setting-exploration

Experience on distance parameter:
Cri: in our community with directional links, 10 km is a good default because people can flash the antenna/router by themself and see that Lime works. in other case, they 
Troian: we are using omnidirectional routers 80 m away from each other, in a line of 3 to 5 routers, so we flash the firmwares with other distances

ASU is amazing. It uses the OpenWrt ImageBuilder
   If we want to use the official ASU server, we need to use ODHCPD for IPv6:
