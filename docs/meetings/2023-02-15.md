## Support for OpenWrt 22.03

We  use this issue for keeping track of the updates:
https://github.com/libremesh/lime-packages/issues/951

 https://github.com/libremesh/lime-packages/pull/959 
When I wrote that pull request, I thought that the new configuration format was due to the swconfig-DSA migration.  But instead it is due to the OpenWrt 19.07 vs >19.07 versions, so I have to rewrite the pull request. 

Proposing:
* supporting only OpenWrt 22.03 in the lime-packages' "master" branch.
* create a "target_OpenWrt_19.07" branch for the extended support to OpenWrt 19.07 and a tag with a minor release "2020.2" which can be considered as an updated version of the 2020.1 LibreMesh release "Expansive Emancipation". 

HOW we will make available this to the users as builded firmware?
- images of master on Owrt22.03 will be linked here: https://libremesh.org/getit.html
- the extended support to Openwrt19.07 can be explicited here: https://libremesh.org/development.html

Other relevant issues for using OpenWrt 22.03 are: 
https://github.com/libremesh/lime-packages/pull/971 (Dnsmasq now can access only specific folders) 
https://github.com/libremesh/lime-packages/pull/950 (we were creating a file that now is provided by an OpenWrt package) 

## QoS,using TC (traffic control) 

FROM Ilario by mailinglist:
My (too complex) dream-solution would be to have an integrated solution with: 
* if you access the AP via a WPA interface, you access a VPN made with Tinc (or Wireguard) and have max priority access to the gateway you own in your house, and mid priority access to the other gateways 
* if you access the AP via an open interface, you get Pirania captive portal, if you have granted access, you have mid-priority access to all the gateways 
* instead, if you Pirania does not grant you the access, you have low priority access to all the gateways
