## Annuncing the new releases
\o/ yhuuuu Lime 2023.1 is out!

firmware selector!!  
https://repo.libremesh.org/selector

One small problem with the compiled images:
they already include a populated /etc/config/lime-community.
This should create a conflict when someone will include (compiling it in or via OPKG) a network-profile
Gothos will compile them again. He originally included the libremesh-default network-profile
Also, some lines are different from the lime-defaults: https://github.com/libremesh/network-profiles/issues/91
    
**TO DO:**
- write a News in the news section (Cri, done)
- change the menu item in the website: Get the last release! (ilario, done)

*A new stable release and a release candidate for Openwrt 22!*

We released a new version of Libremesh based on OpenWrt 19!

https://downloads.libremesh.org/releases/2020.4-ow19/

and a new release candidate based on OpenWrt 22:
https://downloads.libremesh.org/releases/2023.1-rc2-ow22/

This means that the release candidate needs testing, bug fixing and
loads of community love so that we can have an amazing release that can
actually ease the creation of community networks everywhere.

## Tech topics to discuss:
* firmware signatures
* il server delle releases has barely enough storage space and old software.

## Donations
* Fatto curioso di donazioni "spontanee" in chat, che ne pensiamo? Good, but it would be better to have them managed via OpenCollective.
* We should announce that the donation money is available for buying hardware for developers
* FSFE sono interessati a community wireless network per sapere che hardware proprietario ma con software libero usiamo, Cristina gli scrive..
