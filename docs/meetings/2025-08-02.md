### Adding wifi to QEMU simulations

Victor Spehar

Blog post on Freifunk website: https://blog.freifunk.net/2025/07/15/virtual-wifi-in-libremesh-real-virtual-mesh-midterm-project-update/
It's is possible to emulate wifi completely in a qemu virtual machine using mac80211_hwsim (package kmod-mac80211-hwsim in Openwrt)
Using https://github.com/Raizo62/vwifi we can also have multiple VMs talking to each other using emulated Wifi.


New video about testing in LibreMesh https://media.exo.cat/w/vRcjqfLkvqYAXYhYVTkswa

Removed a configuration failure with 6 GHz routers:
https://github.com/libremesh/lime-packages/pull/1207
=> Still some issues when using the high end of the 5g band - no IR)

He improved the TESTING.md file: https://github.com/libremesh/lime-packages/pull/1171

The project can be followed checking these tickets: https://github.com/libremesh/lime-packages/issues/1178

Integrating https://github.com/aparcar/openwrt-tests framework for Libremesh specificities ? So far it's the tests are tailored for Openwrt, some of them could be ported to Libremesh. A fork specific to Libremesh could be made.
The framework is based on Labgrind https://labgrid.readthedocs.io/en/latest/ - it allows to run the tests agnostic of the platform (same tests can be run for a physical router or a virtual device)

#### Watchcat

Support for watchcat (replacing deferrable-reboot) has already been merged: https://github.com/libremesh/lime-packages/pull/1186

#### Virtualizing

The GSoC work from Irina has been merged but some things needed fixing, they listed these things here: https://github.com/libremesh/lime-packages/issues/1172
They fixed some of these things here: https://github.com/libremesh/lime-packages/pull/1173

#### odhcpd

Most of the discussion is on the issue https://github.com/libremesh/lime-packages/issues/1189 or on their pull request https://github.com/libremesh/lime-packages/pull/1199

The dnsmasq->odhcpd part of the GSoC project was wrong in some parts, this resulted in the development of a lease-share code for odhcpd that will be useful for who wants to use only odhcpd but it is not strictly needed for the overall goal of the project (getting closer to OpenWrt).
It is still a mistery why in LibreMesh we are not using dnsmasq+odhcpd-ipv6only as the OpenWrt people do, instead we are still using dnsmasq-dhcpv6. Why? No idea. Asked to Gio here: https://github.com/libremesh/lime-packages/pull/1199#issuecomment-3124678982


## Updates on opening a Mastodon account

Do we have a contact with someone on the Freifunk's Mastodon server?

--> Accept

I have to provide an email, but stil not asked to create :/
I'm in late but I'll do soon.

*Why you want join?*
we are a team of people all around the world developing  a software project form Mesh community. This software is an OS for routers that auto-configure mesh connections. https://Libremesh.org
So we would like have this account to spread news about our work


## Tales from BattleMesh

Victor was there, enjoyed the talks about

https://pretalx.freifunktag.de/battlemesh-v17-2025/talk/LVC8TZ/

Good news from this topic: GSoC - Review and Outlook

https://pretalx.freifunktag.de/battlemesh-v17-2025/talk/833K9R/

## DSA-DSA cabled connection issue

Severe issue affecting even the 2024.1 release.

Described on https://github.com/libremesh/lime-packages/issues/1192

Is being addressed by Gothos with some help by Pony https://github.com/libremesh/lime-packages/pull/1203


## Update on "Routers from Nemael and customs"

The customs have been paid with the funds on OpenCollective and now Agustin has 


## How to have custom script on a build

In the selector is possible ask to add a custom script that will be execute on te first boot the device.
Could be also used to change configuration on that specific device

https://repo.libremesh.org/selector/

### Simplifying LibreMesh

Agustin Trachta

First pull request is here :D
https://github.com/libremesh/lime-packages/pull/1186

https://blog.freifunk.net/2025/06/02/simplifying-libremesh-with-openwrt-native-solutions/

## Testing grant 2025

The project gets money from donations on:
https://opencollective.com/libremesh

And we get part of the money that GSoC gives to mentors. The rest of this money goes to Freifunk.

The grant proposal has been published on the mailing list:
https://lists.autistici.org/message/20250504.153057.850a1bae.en.html

Gothos proposed himself by email:
https://lists.autistici.org/message/20250515.134927.f52ad85a.en.html

No other person proposed during the meeting, so the grant has been assigned to Gothos.

Gothos: in our community, LibreMesh on OpenWrt 24.10 is already in production, with one small workarounds (creating a VLAN on the swconfig device). Devices with DSA and LAN-LAN connection, without any specific configuration, LibreMesh configures the port as LAN-only port. So these devices cannot ping the anygw address. We could resume the cable autodetection project from GSoC 2024 (started by Nemael). I can test lime-app (I did not test it so far, as some routers in our community do not have enough flash memory). If we wanted to skip testing lime-app for focussing on the next release, we could do that.

Ilario: are you proposing to skip OpenWrt 24 and go directly to the next?

Gothos: seems that the next will be OpenWrt 26. We can still test on top of OpenWrt 24 but with more focus on other components like lime-app.

Javier: testing on both OpenWrt 23 and OpenWrt 24?

Ilario: testing latest LibreMesh code on top of OpenWrt 24. If Gothos finds an issue with lime-app, is there anyone able to fix it?

Javier: it's just JavaScript, I can fix it or find people to fix it. Even if we could not fix it, better to test lime-app and to know what works/does not work rather than relying on reports from users.

Gothos: good to test on OpenWrt 24. If we find and fix bugs that could be backported to LibreMesh 2024.1, we could make a release 2024.2 including the fixes.

Ilario: we can pay immediately the hardware, attaching the invoice on the OpenCollective

Gothos: let's buy an OpenWrt One and one low cost device with DSA supported and WiFi 6. In our community we don't need this hardware so we can send it to someone else when it will be needed. Will do between June and July

## Opening a Mastodon account

An email has been sent asking whether people had a favoured server, but no answer was received:
https://lists.autistici.org/message/20250405.165608.914fff7d.en.html

Chris: Freifunk has its own Mastodon server
https://freifunk.social/auth/sign_up

Victor: exo.cat is a fediverse server

Ilaro: exo.cat is a snac server https://exo.cat/fedi/, snac is extremely minimalist, and there is no button for requesting an account, there is only their own account... 

Ilario: fosstodon.org requires invitation. Rules for Freifunk server make sense. Let's join Freifunk's Mastodon server.

Cri: we can migrate later to another server, if we want to. This is a feature of Mastodon.

Ilario: who opens the account?

Cri: I can do that, but do we have any email we can use for opening the account?

Victor: why is LibreMesh not self-hosted?

Ilario: it was kind of self-hosted, now it is still mostly hosted in friendly collectives' servers. So, a few years ago the situation was like this:

* the mailing lists was hosted by Altermundi, you can still see the archive here https://listas.altermundi.net/archives/list/lime-dev@lists.libremesh.org/latest and here https://listas.altermundi.net/archives/list/lime-users@lists.libremesh.org/latest from the latest 2 threads in the archive of the lime-dev mailing list you can see that the hosting was not really working well. So we moved to a server by the Autistici/Inventati collective.
* the web server was hosted by either Altermundi or Codigosur, I am not sure. But at some point (in December 2022 https://lists.autistici.org/message/20221217.145552.c123572f.en.html) it had some problems and stopped working. So we started using Github Pages as a temporary solution and we still have to move it to a hosting we actually like.
* the binary repository for the firmware images was also hosted by Altermundi or Codigosur. The server was extremely outdated and out of space and faulty so we moved to a server hosted by the Val Samoggia network community: https://antennine.noblogs.org/

Ilario: the PeerTube account is registered with my personal email. I can change the email address for the one of the project as soon as we have one.

Cri: I will ask for an email to Autistici/Inventati https://www.autistici.org/

## Presentation of LibreMesh and GSoC @BattleMesh

Victor and Javier are attending.

AndiBrau proposed Victor to present at BattleMesh the GSoC project with an introduction on LibreMesh.

BattleMesh starts on the 10th of June.

Let's draft the outline of the presentation at this document:
https://pad.exo.cat/pad/#/2/pad/edit/RD5xh7L7fhV34ADzDazIgCCy/

Victor: a video with easy setup of a network for your house is missing.

Ilario: Javier, can you do a small workshop during BattleMesh, as it will be recorded?

Javier: it will be cool, and Agustin just did that so they can help. We can do it, I will bring routers.

Cri: will there be any LibreRouter?

Javier: yes, at least one with its box, maybe another without case.

Cri: will there be some LibreRouter to keep in Europe?

Javier: I can bring more, what's the plan?

Cri: in my community maybe we will want some :)

## Routers from Nemael and customs

Nemael sent some routers to Javier, that were sent to them by Aparcar.

The problem is that customs asked around 80 dollars to Javier for receiving the routers. Javier is asking if the project can refund this.

Ilario: let's do that, that's what the money on OpenCollective are for. We just need to upload on OpenCollective the invoice.

Victor, Cri, Gothos: ok!

Ilario and Javier will manage this.
