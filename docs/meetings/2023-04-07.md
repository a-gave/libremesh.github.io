# 2023-04-07 TECH MEETING

**People & list of topics**
Cri, Sam, Ilario

## Updates

Creating the "v2020.2" tag for the release based on OpenWrt 19.07

        git pull upstream OpenWrt_19.07_compatible:OpenWrt_19.07_compatible
        git tag -a v2020.2
        git push upstream-git --tags

And now build!

Build on repo.libremesh.org stops with an error. Maybe due to the old software running on the server??

Several other community networks are using or used LibreMesh on their devices with their own customizations (network profiles), some of these are listed link:https://github.com/libremesh/network-profiles[here].


* Add News on the website? the last is about battlemesh, ok. we can update with the date..( Cri)


* Add list of sure supported device?
https://libremesh.org/docs/hardware/
we have a long list of hardware used in various communities, but we don't know whether they used LibreMesh or not on that!

* Add icon for hardware in documentation page menu
we are using FontAwesome 4.3, which is old. We could use newer FontAwesome...
https://fontawesome.com/v4/icons/
Ilario will update FontAwesome

Ilario rewrites the Get It! page once we have the 2020.2 release

## Need of a Docker image for unit testing on OpenWrt 22.03

Question: about virtualization for testing Libremesh?-> there is the project of the last year and docker images.. moved the conversation on the next topic: need of a Docker image for unit testing on OpenWrt 22.03

https://github.com/libremesh/lime-packages/pull/938
https://github.com/libremesh/lime-packages/issues/389

Sam can ask to aparcar on Element/Matrix list how to buid a Docker image for that

* decide the list of targets for being compiled for release 2020.2 based on OpenWrt 19.07
ath79/generic
ramips/mt7621
x86/64

??ar71xx/generic??

* Add targets to the firmware? https://downloads.libremesh.org/releases/2020.1/targets/
we can add more target for the new release that will be soon?
sam: I would propose to keep ar71xx/generic targets like   

- ubnt-lbe-m5

- ubnt-loco-m-xw

- ubnt-nano-m-xw

- ubnt-nano-m

ar71xx/generic will also be compiled


## Upcoming release LibreMesh 2020.2

vorremmo compilarla ed esporre dal server da cui esponiamo ora: https://downloads.libremesh.org/releases/
Il server non è aggiornato e non builda, quindi bisogna compilare in locale e poi solo uploadarli.
Una volta che ci sono dalla Valsamoggia possiamo testare alcuni target
Poi facciamo annuncio ufficiale
https://github.com/libremesh/lime-packages/tags

Ilario creates a v2020.2 tag at the commit where G10h4ck created the OpenWrt_19.07_compatible branch.

## News about Altermundi roadmap 2023 ?

We have no news, so we can write an email in list and personally to know news.. (Cri)


## How to use the donations on OpenCollective 

(e.g. a compilation server, or donation to Battlemesh) https://opencollective.com/libremesh

Whishlist:
- pay the travel to the battlemesh for some of librerouter/altermundi (maybe next year or another event)
- pay the travel for the travel to battlemesh for some people of Antennine (maybe next year or another event)
- pay the update of the server of downloads CodigoSur? Chiede Cri
- buy some stickers LibreMesh YES
- donation for the domain name? for the newsletter ?
- email @libremesh.org? 
- hardware per testare il supporto?

## News about battlemesh

This year there is not support for the travel
C'è stata un acquisto economico di router per fare la rete di Calafou, c'è il piano di usare Libremesh,
plasmacloud pa1200, che hanno openwrt 22.03(?)
quindi vorremmo arrivare al battlemesh con libremesh basato su openwrt22.03
