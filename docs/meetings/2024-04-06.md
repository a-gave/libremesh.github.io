## New release candidate

Pre-meeting info: a new release candidate has been tagged. It points to the fixed lime-app https://github.com/libremesh/lime-packages/tree/v2024.1-rc1
    Javier feels that we need to test a little bit more
    Hiure will test the release candidate. After his repport, we can release it (or not)


## Sorting of students for GSoC

Pre-meeting info: we have a few students who applied for the Google Summer of Code. The last year, we had to sort them in order to allow Freifunk to select one-two from each sub-project.
Applications here:
https://uz.sns.it/~ilario/gsoc2024/
Note: Mael Panouillot applied for two projects, but wrote us specifying that would prefer to work on Cable Purpose Autodetection

Sorted as:
   - LibreMesh Cable Purpose Autodetection: Mael Panouillot
   - LibreMesh Internet Control: Ajay Chauhan
   - Libremesh Pirania, new release: Henrique Mohr

## Updates on the testing grant

Pre-meeting info: Pony sent the report https://lists.autistici.org/message/20240224.195742.4837407c.en.html
if this is approved during the meeting, we can give the second half of the grant.
    The group defined that this report was approved
    
Hiure seems will test the just-released new version of lime-app before sending the final report.

Hiure started a new round of tests in a small testbed, he also found some problems recently where not all network profiles are able to compile the firmware (seems some depencencies issue)

Pony are using wpa_cli, a command line tool to switch APs and seems its taking some time to reconect (roaming test)

Test about name resolution: 
    Hiure: problem with local server with offline ssl certificate, the server was in one cloud (network) and then when he tried to access it from another cloud (connected by cable) it's wasn't reachable (2 different meshs connected by cable)
    
Pony tested name resolution of routers in 2 clouds and it worked fine

Hiure mentioned about shared'state package for DNS local server resolution but it wasn't tested yet

Javier asked Hiure to write down what his found to improve bat name
