we need to write a page on the website guiding the communities to write a network-profile - Cri & Ilario will do that

aggiornare/scrivere lista delle comunità che usano libremesh, chiedere consenso di metterli in home page:

we have a big problem with the "distance" parameter, now it is 1 km for 5 GHz and 100 m for 2.4 GHz. There is an "auto" setting for the ath9k???????????????????????? We have to underline this setting everywhere. https://github.com/aredn/aredn_ar71xx/search?q=distance&type=issues we could have a setting like this: if a positive value is provided, just use the value; if a negative distance is provided, check somehow if the "auto" value can be used, otherwise use the absolute value as the distance. In Aredn they check for the existence of /sys/kernel/debug/ieee80211/$phy/ath9k before activating the auto setting. 
 
For Freifunk communities based on Gluon the automatic distance / dynack feature is enabled by default (distance = 0 in UCI). However some communities have experienced issues with using dynack, leading to TX path hangs (stuck transmissions until resetting the wifi chip) especially in croweded areas and went back to a static distance setting.
 
Freifunk Vogtland went first to 3km distance setting and still / again got TX path hangs and now settled to 1km:
