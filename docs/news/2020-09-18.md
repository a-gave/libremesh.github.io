# 2020-09-18 - A release candidate for the next release!

Although the LibreMesh development never stopped, it was since the 17.06
"Dayboot Rely" release that we didn't have an _official_ release.
The goal is to have the **final release at the beginning of November**.

This means that the release candidate needs testing, bug fixing and
loads of community love so that we can have an amazing release that can
actually ease the creation of community networks everywhere.

Check out the [announcement](https://web.archive.org/web/20220716110806/https://lists.libremesh.org/archives/list/lime-users@lists.libremesh.org/thread/72K6ZKQEKSOOVSPPXCD77ZP4EZWOSWBN)
for more detailed information.
