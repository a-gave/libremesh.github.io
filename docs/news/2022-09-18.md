# 2022-09-18 - Participation to BattleMesh v14 in Rome

LibreMesh supports this year's "Wireless Battle of the Mesh - Building Community Networks for Fun and Non-Profit".

The event aims to bring together people from across the globe who are interested in community networks, including wireless mesh network technologies, fiber infrastructure, Do-It-Yourself Internet Access Providers, and more generally how to create and maintain a thriving community of people involved in building their own networks.

We envision 4 days of expert presentations, practical workshops, hacking sessions, and fruitful discussions: whether you are a mesh networking enthusiast, community networking activist, protocol developer, or have an interest in networking in general, come and join the event!

The Battlemesh is free of charge and open for all.

This year, the event will take place from Monday 19th to Thursday 22nd of September, 2022 in Rome, Italy!
