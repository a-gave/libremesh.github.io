# 2017-06-06 - Attended Sysupgrades

Within this years [GSoC](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com) a fellow student tries to setup a new way to perform sysupgrades on LibreMesh Routers (and LEDE/OpenWrt in general).
The idea is to generate sysupgrade images on demand with all manually installed packages included. 

More details are shown in the official [Freifunk Blogpost](https://blog.freifunk.net/2017/05/30/gsoc-2017-attended-sysupgrade/) (english)
