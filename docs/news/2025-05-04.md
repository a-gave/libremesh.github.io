# 2025-05-04 - LibreMesh 2024.1 release

The LibreMesh community is enthusiast to finally announce a new release of LibreMesh:
LibreMesh 2024.1 "Fantastic Forwarder".

Four years of work and testing, [334 commits](https://github.com/libremesh/lime-packages/compare/v2020.4...v2024.1) since LibreMesh 2020.4 in the lime-packages repository only, 10 developers, many improvements and the updated support for OpenWrt 23.05!

A big news first: this LibreMesh release can be downloaded and customized online (!!!) using a tool developed by the OpenWrt community: the firmware selector. This is a large step forward in one of our main objective: enable everyone to build a network community, without being a shell-ninja. Enjoy it at this link: https://repo.libremesh.org/selector/

### What's new in 2024.1 "Fantastic Forwarder"

It is impossible to do a meaningful list of all the changes. A non complete list of the most relevant
developments:

* Compatibility with the new firewall adopted by modern OpenWrt: nftables;
* Compatibility with the new configuration method for switches (DSA) while maintaining the compatibility with the old one (swconfig);
* Compatibility with the usage of ujail introduced in OpenWrt for additional security;
* Incorporate a [new version of shared-state](https://github.com/libremesh/lime-packages/tree/master/packages/shared-state-async) written from scratch for performances;
* Many fixes and code improvement, also coming from the testing grants funded with the [donations collected on OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/libremesh).
