# 2023-10-07 - A new stable release and a release candidate for Openwrt 22!

We released a new version of Libremesh based on OpenWrt 19!

https://downloads.libremesh.org/releases/2020.4-ow19/

and a new release candidate based on OpenWrt 22:

https://downloads.libremesh.org/releases/2023.1-rc2-ow22/


::: info
Firmware images of libremesh-2020.4 based on openwrt-19.07.10, were signed with the wrong signing keys.
To install additional `kernel_modules` via `opkg`:

- Add the build repository for the selected `target/subtarget` here *ar71xx/generic*:
```
echo "src/gz libremesh_kmods http://downloads.libremesh.org/releases/2020.4-ow19/targets/ar71xx/generic/packages" >> /etc/opkg/limefeeds.conf
```
- Then add the signing key:
```
cat << EOF > /etc/opkg/keys/c37d41571f77f282
untrusted comment: signed by libremesh.org for 2020.4 release builds
RWTDfUFXH3fygrM5F7kON6UQTWjWG9aNVBSNFnUv3cHXJjFVmZrGJ6Iw
EOF
```
:::

This means that the release candidate needs testing, bug fixing and
loads of community love so that we can have an amazing release that can
actually ease the creation of community networks everywhere.
