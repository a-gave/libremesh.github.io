# 2018-04-13 - Join us at Mesh is in the Air!

We endorse [Mesh is in the Air](https://www.wireless-meshup.org) - this years mesh up of the [Wireless Battle of the Mesh](https://www.battlemesh.org) and [Wireless Community Weekend](https://wiki.freifunk.net/Wireless_Community_Weekend_2018).

If you are a mesh networking enthusiast, community activist, have an interest in wifi or dynamic routing protocols, you can't miss this event! Check out more details in the [official website](https://www.wireless-meshup.org).

LibreMesh developers and users will be attending the event, giving talks about development progress and state, and in general sharing a nice time.
